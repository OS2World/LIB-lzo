ChangeLog for LZO -- a real-time data compression library
============================================================================

Changes in 0.28 (22 Feb 1997): public release
  - new algorithm LZO1Y: LZO1Y-999 and LZO1Y decompressor
  - added lzo1x_optimize() and lzo1y_optimize()
  - minor speedup in assembler decompressors (i386+gcc)
  - lzo_test.c rewritten

Changes in 0.27 (19 Jan 1997): public release
  - fixed a bug in LZO1B-999 and LZO1C-999 that could produce
    wrong compressed data in very rare cases

Changes in 0.26 (18 Jan 1997)
  - LZO is now distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
  - added LZO1B-999
  - renamed LZO1D to LZO2A (also updated all docs)
  - some cleanups

Changes in 0.25 (28 Dec 1996)
  - some portability fixes (LZO now works on my old Atari ST :-)
  - adapted for Autoconf 2.12

Changes in 0.24 (30 Nov 1996)
  - improved Pentium performance of LZO1X assembler decompressor (i386+gcc)

Changes in 0.23 (23 Nov 1996): public release
  - added LZO1C, LZO1F and LZO1X decompressors in assembler (i386+gcc)
  - added corresponding LZO_PUBLIC to all LZO_EXTERN functions
  - added support for Microsoft C 7.0 (16 bit MSDOS)
  - introduced lzo_uint32. This could prove useful for a strict 16 bit
    version that doesn't use 'huge' pointers.
  - all algorithms use incremental hashing now
  - some cleanups and portability fixes

Changes in 0.22 (19 Sep 1996): public release
  - LZO1X: minor decompressor speedup, added some checks in safe decompressor
  - autoconf: added detection of gcc strength-reduction bug
  - Makefile changes

Changes in 0.21 (08 Sep 1996): public release
  - added GNU autoconf support, makefiles changed, added config directory
  - a few cosmetical changes
  - added 'official' LZO benchmark (see util/bench.sh)

Changes in 0.20 (11 Aug 1996): public release
  - new algorithm LZO1X: LZO1X-1, LZO1X-999 and LZO1X decompressor
  - significantly speeded up LZO1B, LZO1C and LZO1F decompressors
    on CPUs which allow unaligned memory access (e.g. Intel 80x86)
  - greatly speeded up LZO2A-999 compressor at the cost of some memory
  - some cleanups, portability fixes and minor speedups

Changes in 0.16 (22 Jul 1996): public release
  - speeded up LZO1F decompressor a little bit
  - improved LZO1F-999 compression ratio
  - removed contrib directory

Changes in 0.15 (10 Jul 1996): public release
  - new algorithm LZO1F: LZO1F-1, LZO1F-999 and LZO1F decompressor
  - improved LZO2A-999 compression ratio
  - removed LZO1E as it is dominated by LZO1F

Changes in 0.14 (06 Jul 1996)
  - experimental algorithms: LZO1E and LZO1F
  - added LZO_EXTERN to all prototypes. Useful when building a DLL.
  - improved LZO1C-999 and LZO2A-999 compression ratio a little bit
  - fixed progress indicator callback (it was called only once)

Changes in 0.13 (20 Jun 1996): public release
  - LZO2A compressed data format changed from v0.12
  - some speed improvements in LZO1C-999 and LZO2A-999
  - do not use '-fbounds-checking' by default in Makefile

Changes in 0.12 (18 Jun 1996)
  - added standalone version of LZO1C-1 compressor and LZO1C decompressor
    in the ./extra directory for easy inclusion in applications
  - added LZO1C-999, a slow but nearly optimal compressor
    intended for generating pre-compressed data
  - added tests for lookbehind-overrun in all safe decompressors
  - source tree completely rearranged, some filenames changed
  - extensions changed: a .ch file is a C source code that is included
    for reasons of code sharing
  - new algorithm LZO2A: LZO2A-999 and LZO2A decompressor. There is
    no fast compressor yet.
  - some cleanups

Changes in 0.11 (29 May 1996): public release
  - source tree rearranged
  - LZO now compiles fine as a C++ library (interface still has C linkage)
  - improved overall compression ratio a little bit
  - LZO1B-99/LZO1C-99 now search for longer matches (MATCH_IP_END)
  - LZO_HASH_LZO_INCREMENTAL is working, it's a little bit faster
  - added unused_dict_entries in statistics
  - Makefile changed
  - fixed a typo in COPY_M2X
  - added lzo_uint and lzo_sizeof in some places
  - split LZO1B compressor into even more include-files

Changes in 0.10 (20 May 1996): first public release of the LZO library
  - includes LZO1, LZO1A, LZO1B and LZO1C algorithms
    (compression levels 1-9 and 99)

14 Mar 1996:
  - release of the LZO1A algorithm in the Internet newsgroups
    comp.compression and comp.compression.research

04 Mar 1996:
  - release of the LZO1 algorithm in the Internet newsgroups
    comp.compression and comp.compression.research
